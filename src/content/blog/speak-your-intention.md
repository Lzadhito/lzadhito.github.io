Have you ever stopped yourself from giving lesson about your good deed because you afraid that you might want to show off? It feels safer to keep it to yourself, right?

But here’s the twist: saying it out loud might be exactly what helps you to prevent it.

How? even though saying out loud could stumble you into "seeking affirmation" area, conversely it could help you build commitment that help you to be consistent.

Classic Sales and Marketing book, Influence by Robert B. Cialdini talks about people who state their intentions publicly will far more likely to follow through. It’s a psychological thing we naturally want to act in ways that match what we’ve said.

Sure, Cialdini mostly used this idea to explain how marketers or salespeople influence behavior, but the same principle works beautifully for building habits too. When you speak your goals out loud to a friend, your partner, or even yourself you’re not just sharing an idea; you’re setting an expectation. You’re telling your mind, “This is who I am becoming.” And the more you speak it, the more real it starts to feel.

You might still hurt your inner self though, so use it when you know your heart would not affected from it. It's a behavioral science anyway, not tazkiyatun nafs (purification of soul). Make sure you ask for Allah help.
