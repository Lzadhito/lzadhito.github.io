For me, reading is a difficult task. I've been living with video games, videos, and audios for my entire life. I've been playing video games since kindergarten even somehow I managed to learned life lesosns from video games, youtube videos, or movies. Eventhough, I'm always having self-dialogue while in transport to reflect what was happened or to internalize the learned lesson to expand on a new knowledge.

If I write it correctly, none of my knowledge above came from books. Yes, I could said that lessons in video games, videos, audios, and teach by another are coming from books, but with that mentality I'll always be standing behind the people who read and waiting them to animate it in videos.

Thus, reading a book for me is like compounding in blue chips. Each time I complete a book is like a winning in a very good investment portofolio, it's an award for me to stack some inventory in living a better life. With that, I'm going to write what I read, what I understand, and I hope people who read this blogs would get benefit from it even a little.
