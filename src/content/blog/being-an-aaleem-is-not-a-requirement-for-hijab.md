Let's start with appreciation to women who use hijabs. It is notoriously a hard decision to use it consistently, more especially if you're surrounding aren't using one. Regardless your hijab style, I know how far you've progress and its always one of the beautiful moment on every woman. Not only the woman itself, your surrounding might also too. I always remember how I always moved when I remember how my wife decide that she'll use it permanently. So let's keep fight on your struggle Allah will always and always help you through it. Moreover, this post is not for you, this is for people who said "don't use hijab if you aren't ready!" and to move the mind of people who said "how shameful that hijab woman who done X Y Z".

So I just found a thread that congratulating a person who just put off her hijab and said "It's good because she's not munafiq. She put it off because she's not ready". One of the dumbest thing I found in internet today, even dumber than the memes sent daily by my friends.

Do you only do investing when you're rich? Does investing means you're rich? Does investing are exclusive for rich people? You know that only 10% - 20% of traders who profit right? and even only 4% who make a living from it. Does that means because the chance is not that big so you just abandon all of the financial literacy, the savings, the planning, the financial freedom, etc.?  

Using hijab is one of the mandatory things in Islam, but being an aaleem is not the requirement to use it. Using it doesn't automatically put you to the heaven list **nor** unusing it put you to the hell list. But let's be clear, not using it is a big sin and not using it doesn't mean she's kafir and say "lets skip all Allah rules shall we" (based on most Syafii's scholars which Indonesians hold on to, lets skip the fiqh ruling here).

Hijab is one of the mandatory check in Islam. But there's more to it! there's salah, fasting, amanah, not doing dzhalim, etc. Aren't you tired watching how Indonesian big scammers from the women mostly using hijab? aren't you tired being shown how the one whose not amanah drinking his water sitting? ITS IS BECAUSE THEY'RE ONLY DOING SOME OF THE INSTRUCTION, YOU'RE NOT OBLIGATED TO GENERALIZE THEM AS AALEEMS ~~you dumbass!~~.

Still not intigrued aren't you? Let's use an extreme analogy here for you wise thinker. If a person quit watching porn, and then sometime he watched it again would you congratulate them? would you consider them as not munafiq because they're back to where they was? would you tell them that it's good for them because they're not ready to quit porn? Quitting porn is a very good thing for them both on they psychology and their iman. If they're back to it that doesn't mean that they're not ready, and quitting it without proper preparation considered as munafiq.

Let's address the elephant in the room here. If you see a person that wore off her hijab that doesn't mean that her previous life considered munafiq. Might be there something happened with her that us as their good friend might give her some healthy naseehah instead of considering her past as munafiq. Let's not generalize things shall we? let's not consider hijab is only for aaleems. Please be careful when having muamalah with all people including the hijabs or the bearded men with their masyaallah words before you got scammed on their travel agency or their syaria properties.

This got my head too hot to continue this post. Just let's not too soon to generalize people shall we? and lets clear this obligation to be aaleem first before using hijab from the people stigma.
