The reason on why people do this is their background. The secondhand might be used by previous financially limited childhood that only use secondhand, then doing it again even after the situtation changed. The "always new" came from the background when new things always provided. This is just an example, where the real life are more than that. The environment we live, the decisions we made or made for us, things that everyone is unique from the others. Thus, knowing how the background would help to prevent judging the others financialy "stupid".
