`The Psychology of Money` will be the first book I'll be summarizing for. Let's start with the introduction that Moragan Housel brings us:

> "doing well with money has a little to do with how smart you are and a lot to do with how you behave"

We already know where the inherits succumb to bankrupt in just small time of period. We also know how the "new money" people would only last for a while. What matters is not their financial background, nor how good they are in solely getting their income (well, maybe exception to parents whose money enough for generations). How they react to money, big numbers, then turned it around compounding it would be a better factors.

The example on the book is comparing how a man who only have house with 2 bedroom worth 8 million dollar in 2014 to a sucessfull CEO who bought a mansion worth $90.000 to maintain each month fall into bankruptcy in the same year. The reason lies in how they behave to what they have.
