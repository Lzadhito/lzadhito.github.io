I always thought not using the coat would be the best idea if the rain hasn't started yet until, I learn about the base characters of each human: "Always want more". The branch of it is the opportunist. Even though I self-claimly not considered myself one, but I always find myself pusing through the ideal output. Just the previous week, I tried to put the coat before the rain and gladly found that it's not bad att all! its far more better than being soaked wet and even better than stopping a while to put a coat!

Recently I just learn about the urgency of tolerating errors in personal finance. I learn that having backup plan before starting risks is probably more ideal than gaining the most but risk everything. I didn't expect this principe apply in my other sectors in my life outside the financial sector. Alhamdulillah Allah gave me this knowledge that I can apply anywhere.

Disclaimer: Even though this post about "safety net", be aware that safety net is a net. It catches you when you fall, not the place you should call home. Safety net is important if you take risks, if you don't take risks then probably your safety net would be the risks in the future.
