Let me start with the quotes from Imam Syafi

> "If you can't stand the fatigue of study, you will feel the poignant of stupidity." - Imam Syafi'i

Let me rephrase the quote with "patience"

> "If you can't be patient on studying, you'll need to be patient on the poor life caused by your ignorance."

It's a quote directed to the muslims to learn about their deen seriously to live a better life. Turns out, its a basic that applied to every categories in our life. I mean all of them, literally all of them! family, relationships, finance, career, business, networking, and others are always apply this basic.

## Family & Relationships

Family is a long game. To educate some principles among your children then you need to be patient on dealing with your children screams, cries, being kind while thrown a toy, being strict or sometime rigid, and probably staying sane. If you want to only have fun with them on their young age, then you probably found them in the opposite of what you expect in the later life.

If you happen to have a fight in a relationship, even with your children, or your parents then you need to be patient on communicating the problems and finding the solutions that sometimes feel like talking with a hot steam in a hot sauna as a hot pot. If you always avoiding the difficult talk, then probably you will face the cold war the rest of your life (or maybe a real war if you came from an outspoken family or a physically responsive).

## Finance

Finance is not an exception. If you always spend your money while it lasts, then you will live your life when it lasted. There's a common principal from the richs, it sounded like these

> "If you want to live in luxury later, then you need to be patient living frugaly when you're young. If you want to live luxury live now, then you'll be forced to live frugaly later."

Even though I don't even remember if the "frugal" word exist, but I hope you get the point. If your parents not rich, or your parent cannot give you sufficient money for you to start a business or startup, then be patient on saving your own! And if your parents rich but somehow now the inherited money starts to run out, or your parents business starts to fail when your parents no longer in charge, and you barely have an income that cover your daily needs, then you need to adjust what your daily needs!

Saving, limit the expenses, adjusting the standards is one of the important things in financial. If you don't do these early then you will be forced to have a limited expense, and missing the needs that still in your standard. You might need to gain certain of money for you to start a business, to start risky things, and to have a freedom.  

## Career, Business, and Networking

The same goes to your career. You need to be patience viewed as a learner, and the learning itself. Learn new things and sharpen your skill to amped up your value. You might need to be patience to do deals in business, and you need to patience on reading the market needs. Networking is the hardest thing for me personally to be patient. I hate dealing with two faces guy, I hate dealing with people who constantly lies or even having white lies just to satisfy the stakeholders or their partners. Don't forget that there also people who feel their already on top of the world. But networking is networking, even you already chose the environment you want to network in you will always find three or four people that have this treat. Be patience, and learn how to deal with them. If not, then you will stuck in your current state probably the rest of your life, you'll need to be patience on not progressing.

## Summary

Everything needs sacrifice, and most of the time the sacrifice need patience. The result if you skip it, then you will need to be patience living in the life that constantly gave you difficulties that you don't know how to solve it. If you give the effort for more patiences either on learning, preparing, and facing the actual problems before more problem come, at least you know how to deal with constant difficulties gaven to you.
