This is my takeaway of book `The Psychology of Money` chapter `Confounding Compounding`, `Getting Wealthy vs Staying Wealthy`, `Tails, You Win`. While reading the first two chapter kinda "You Don't Say" for me, when getting into the third it's blowing me away on how correlated the previous two chapters to foundate the third one. Let's start with first two chapter:

## Confounding Compounding

Warren Buffet, one of the richest person in the world. What made his nett worth up so high? investing. Really really successfull investments. Well there might be more than just investing, but lets stay on that. Even though books, articles, and public exampled him for his investment strategies, decision, and picking the best options, but The Psychology of Money reveal that his secret not lies within expertise in current age, but it's investment journey started since Warren was 11. He accumulating money from 6 until enough for him to start his first portofolio in 11.

He started by saving his money, then he started the investment from $114 into $1 million in his 30. Getting $999.886 in 19 years, starting your age was 11 are crazy. You need at least $83.000 each year to save. But the thing is, his $114 not only saved stagnant, instead it is exponentially increasing throught the years. His earnings are reinvested to generate their own earnings.

Even though my example only in stock investment area, but it also apply everywhere. The takeaway is, even though you only have small, it's better start to compound it rather than spending it all.

## Getting Wealthy vs Staying Wealthy

Let's get straight to the point, getting wealthy (income generation) and staying wealthy (wealth preservation) is a different skillset, and the second might be harder than the first. Factors range from greed to saving issue, might be the person always taking high risk, not planning backup, not definig safe zone, don't know how to save, hard time to save money, excessive spending behavior, etc.

Good to know that you need savings. Saving for living when you have no income, saving to retry another business, saving when things start to fall and fail. For example the first might cost you 3 month living expense to save, and in current economy you might to expand to 6 month, and if you are sandwich you might need to increase the value or expand it to 8 month or 10. The second might and the third might be doubling your budget before starting business, but that's my opinion from a non business man.

This is the part when you learn that risk management is one of the important topics in financial.

## Tails, You Win

This is when the previous started to connect. But let's start with the chapter itself. Winning the tails means the effort already run through numeruous time before starting to fruit, the fruit is only the tail after head, and the whole body. An expert might only win 65% in his area (say, business or investments) while the beginner could stomped the rate significantly lower. Regardless the low rate to win, everyone need to step into the long journey of failing, learning, and trying again until they harvested the seed they planted.

With this in mind, the previous chapters start making sense. To win, you need to Compound. Either in skills, investment, or experiences. You might see the result far from the starting point, so that's why Staying Wealthy is important. You might need a lot of taking breath before you starting new things.

Keep your pocket and your mind ready for failures, a lot. Define your safe zone, if you want to play risky, consider to move back when the risk happened. Imagine a small circle inside a bigger circle. The small circle is the safe zone, and its outer is the risky zone. Starting from the safe zone, if you fail in the risk zone you can just fallback into the smaller circle which is the safe area.

The good thing is the safe zone might expand the more skill and experience you have. Keep moving forward and know when to get back. Fail is inevitable.
