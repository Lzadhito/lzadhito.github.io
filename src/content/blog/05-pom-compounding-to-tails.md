This is my takeaway of book `The Psychology of Money` chapter `Confounding Compounding`, `Getting Wealthy vs Staying Wealthy`, `Tails, You Win`. While reading the first two chapter kinda "You Don't Say" for me, when getting into the third it's blowing me away on how correlated the previous two chapters to foundate the third one. Let's start with first two chapter:

## Confounding Compounding

Warren Buffet, one of the richest person in the world. What made his nett worth up so high? It's his investing. Really really successfull investments (Well there might be more than just investing, but lets stay on that). Even though books, articles, and public exampled him for his investment strategies, The Psychology of Money reveal that his secret not lies within his current expertise, but his investment journey since he was 11 (by that age I'm playing counter strike and ninja saga).

He started by saving his money since he was 6, then he started the investment from $114 into $1 million in his 30. Look at that! getting $999.886 in 19 years, and starting in the age of 11 is crazy. He need at least $83.000 each year to save. But the thing is, his $114 not saved still instead it is increasing exponentially throught out the years. His earnings reinvested again to generate their own earnings.

Even though my example only in stock investment area, but it also apply everywhere. The takeaway is, even though you only have small, it's better start to compound it rather than spending it all.

## Getting Wealthy vs Staying Wealthy

Let's get straight to the point, getting wealthy (income generation) and staying wealthy (wealth preservation) is a different skillset, and the second might be harder than the first. Factors range from greed to saving issue. Might be the person always taking high risk, not planning backup, nor defining safe zone, or don't know how to save properly, excessive spending behavior, etc.

The takeaway is good to know that you need savings. Saving for living when you have no income, saving to retry another business, saving when things start to fall and fail. For example, the first might cost you 3 month living expense to save, and in current economy you might to expand to 6 month, and if you are a sandwich then you might need to increase the value or expand it to 8 month or maybe 10.

This is the part when you learn that risk management is one of the important topics in financial. Create backup, define safe zone.

## Tails, You Win

This is when the things start to connecting. But let's start with the chapter itself. Winning the tails means the effort already run through numeruous time before starting to fruit, the tail is a small thing after the head, and the whole body. An expert might only win 65% in his area (say, business or investments) while the beginner could stomped the rate significantly lower. Regardless the low rate to win, everyone need to step into the long journey of failing, learning, and trying again until they harvested the seed they planted.

With this in mind, the previous chapters start playing their role. To win, you need to "Compound". Either in skills, investment, or experiences. You might see the result far from the starting point, a lot of challenges and fall ahead, so that's why "Staying Wealthy" is important. You might need a lot of taking breath before you starting new things.

Keep your pocket and your mind ready for failures, a lot. Define your safe zone. If you want to play risky, consider to move back when the risk happened. Imagine a small circle inside a bigger circle. The small circle is the safe zone, and its outer is the risky zone. Starting from the safe zone, if you fail in the risk zone you can just fallback into the smaller circle which is the safe area.

The good thing is the safe zone might expand the more skill and experience you have. Keep moving forward and know when to get back. Fail is inevitable.

## Summary

To summarize you need to play the long game to win. The long game means you need a lot of resources, and it literally money. You need to be somewhat paranoia to define the saving target, and frugal to save. But that doesn't mean you need to save all of your money, you still need to move forward reaching you goals, which often require money. To reach your goal, you need a lot of effort, and will be a lot of raise and fall. Not only saving help the fall, it also help to raise again when you ready. Either the raise or the saving, both of them need to do it gradually, both of them need to be compound.
