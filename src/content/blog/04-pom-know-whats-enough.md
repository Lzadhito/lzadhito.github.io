Know that after having much, we would crave more

This is my journal of `Psychology of Money` chapter `Enough`. FYI currently I haven't read all the chapter yet, but I don't really get it why this topic explained early. I think this chapter is to either help us defining our goals with money or to explaining our limitation as a human.

I start with my existing knowledge about the humans.

 لَوْ أَنَّ ابْنَ آدَمَ أُعْطِيَ وَادِيًا مَلأً مِنْ ذَهَبٍ أَحَبَّ إِلَيْهِ ثَانِيًا وَلَوْ أُعْطِيَ ثَانِيًا أَحَبَّ إِلَيْهِ ثَالِثًا، وَلاَ يَسُدُّ جَوْفَ ابْنِ آدَمَ إِلاَّ التُّرَابُ

If the son of Adam were given a valley full of gold, he would love to have a second one; and if he were given the second one, he would love to have a third, for nothing fills the belly of Adam's son except dust.

In my case, I saw this phenomenon very often within the low economic class public. After getting a large sum amount of money, instead of they being grateful, being loyal, they'll just jump into another thing that generate another money. No, they don't just being hustle, they also tearing down the loyalty from the previous giver.

Turns out this also happens in all economic tier. The book gave an example of a very successful former managing director at McKinsey. He started low, climbing high into the director position, then committing fraud, just because he never seems enough.

Instead the book gave 4 takeaway points:

1. The hardest financial skill is getting the goalpost to stop moving
2. Social comparison is the problem here.
3. "Enough" is not too little
4. There are many things never was risking, no matter the potential gain
