It's still hurt isn't it? even after you get through all of this journey when you try to surf back into that moment you still hurting aren't you?

That's why what you really need is to move on, put that behind, then detach any attachment hanging on to you. Any trigger surely will pull you back, but with your detachment at least you have a decision that you hadn't before.

There's a story about psychiatrist which giving a harsh advice but really effective to his patient. When talking about the patient trauma about his past with his mother who doesn't love him, the psychiatrist advice more or less "If you want to get through, then you need to choose whether your mother love will decide your future or not."

To generalized

> If you need to get through this life then you need to decide that your past will not decide your future
