Ever talk with an old man about how to deal with their wive or kids and turns out the only advice is to be patient? The more make sense solution is to talk about things that matters and tolerate what's not, having goals, etc. Right? It seems the sensible solution is the easiest part, while running it from end to end is the hardest. Executing the idea without any preparation would be disastrous. Thus, high requirement of patient is needed to run it.

I was playing [Numay](https://numay.xyz) with my wife. She cross a question "What advice would you give to a person who doesn't loved by their family?", the answer I gave "Don't let anyone decide your life". She said "what kind of irrelevant answer is that?". She would prefer to view life about giving love instead of being loved, then as long as giving love is the most matters then being loved is not mandatory.

Actually my answer is somehow the same even though the approach are different. What I meant by "Don't let anyone decide your life" is every person need to set a high/noble/glorious goals in their life, run it, execute it on your lifetime. Regardless your parents like it or not, as long as it is good thing then just do it! Abraham father doesn't love him, at least after Abraham try opposite the public beliefs. Does Abraham sad? yes he does! but he continue his journey with elegance. He do pray for his father but he don't try to please his father to love him that hard him nor doing disastrous thing. He decide to continue pursuing his goals regardless he is banished by his father.
