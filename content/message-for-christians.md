A lot of things that I really wanted to talk about Christians but neither do I have the capacity nor the bravery. I came from a family with various beliefs: Islam, Christian, Liberal, and Indonesian Kejawen. Besides Muslims, Christian people always have enough respect in my side especially after my Christian boss gave me more tolerance to practice Islam than my previous Muslim boss (⚠ this is not to be generalized, it will be another story itself).

From that, I sometimes really want a goodness for the Christians. In some way it got me through some of these messages:

# Christians (people) are supported in Muslim best reference.

In Islam we only have 4 source to learn, sorted by the lowest rank: (1) Qiyaas: the analogical reasoning or deduction (2) Ijma: the concensus between the scholars (3) Sunnah: The spoken, act, or approval from Prophet Muhammad ﷺ (4) Al-Quran: the holiest and the best reference for Muslims to learn about life. Starting from the best reference, other references are used to support each other to manage through modernization or edge cases, i.e: the obligation to Salah stated on Quran, but how to do it are from hadith.

Allah never revealed unimportant message, that's why so many big names never mentioned on the Quran neither it is a person, races, clans, or religions. Meanwhile, Christians and their history is not the case.

## 1. Najran Massacre

This is the messages from surah Al-Buruj. Allah condemn the massacre act by the Jews to the Christians. This surah also honored the Christians on how they surrender their body to the pit of fire for them to only to be a faithful person. They do have the options to stay or revert back to Judaism, but they remain in the truth. One of the surah message is to encourage people to stay witihn the truth how hard the situation can be.

## 2. The Revelation of Rome's victory over Persia 13 years before it happens

Surah Ar-Rum is mainly about Rome's victory. The surah revealed at 615 A.D, which Rome ruled by Christian practices. Just to reveal 13 years after it that the Rome gain a great victory after a long war with Persia at 628 A.D. The surah given down to Muhammad ﷺ at the hardest day of Rome when the news spreaded about the Roman Empire being defeated by the Persians.

Fun fact, The Muslims cheer after this revelation since they never had a single doubt about what revealed by Allah even on the most difficult situation and They cheer more on the victorious day itself after 13 years waiting for it. The message is to encourage people of Allah's promise that will never be broken.

# P.S.

For writing this post, what I really wanted is to you (either you are Christian, Muslim, or practicing any other religion) ask to God sincerely with an honest heart seeking for guidance, seek to be guided the truth even how hard it is to swallow. Also ask God to be eased for the process.

This post started when I eager to talk about The Council of Nicaea, how Trinity started officialized. If you somehow curious about my post about it, and you miss it please ask me on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/lzadhito).
